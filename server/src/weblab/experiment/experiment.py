        This method indicates that a student has been assigned to use this
        laboratory. client_initial_data will provide the data (typically a
        JSON-serialized string) that the experiment client submitted (if any),
        and server_initial_data is a JSON-serialized string with the data passed
        by the core server. This includes the time slot available for the
        current user, the priority, etc.

        This method must return a JSON-serialized string which can be an empty
        object ("{}"), but it can state that it is a batch experiment (and
        therefore the scheduler will mark it as free once the start method has
        finished), and it can provide information that the client will receive
        (such as "the URL for the camera in this copy of the laboratory is this
        one").

        Reports the api version that the experiment uses. The default api level is the
        current one. Experiments may override this method to return a different one.

        TODO: Providing such a default might lead to errors, because if a new api was released
        old experiments which didn't override get_api would without warning be using a wrong api.
        It might be safer to enforce get_api() overriding, or to at least issue some kind of
        warning if an experiment doesn't.
