# should feature a functional machine, already started and with

# of the Virtual Machine. The default one, HttpQueryUserManager, is
# compatible with the VNC and RDP password changers that WebLab
# provides, and will simply send the request through HTTP to the
# URL specified below. Though the system is designed to be extensible,
# generally it won't be advisable to create a custom User Manager.

# configuration do match. 
# When deploying an experiment for real use, it is important to configure
