# Scheduler is the basic abstract class from which all schedulers
# inherit. It provides the generic scheduler arguments to all the
# implementations, and defines the interface that will be used by
# the Coordinator.
#
# In order to implement a new scheduler, implement this interface
# and add your model to the "CoordinatorModel.load" method. As long
# as it uses CoordinatorModel.Base as sqlalchemy Base, it will be
# deployed by the WebLab deployment tools, and managed with the
# coordinator configuration parameters.
#
# XXX The interface below has been extracted from PriorityQueueScheduler, the original WebLab-Deusto scheduler. It will change to support other schemas.
