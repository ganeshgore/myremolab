    The Independent Scheduler Aggregator aggregates different
    schedulers that schedule independent resources. For
    instance, one experiment that can be executed in two
    different types of "rigs" will be waiting in two queues
    at the same time. This class will handle established
    policies such as priorities among schedulers.

    Take into account that a possible scheduler is an external
    scheduler (such as another WebLab-Deusto). Therefore
    policies can become complex here.

    In summary, IndependentSchedulerAggregator is an 'OR'
    aggregator, since it reserves in all the aggregated
    schedulers and then it it responds with the best option.

    Therefore, while it is compliant with the Scheduler
    API, it can not be configured as such in the core config
    files: it will be created by the coordinator in the
    constructor, creating one per experiment_id.

# The SharedSchedulerAggregator is a scheduler aggregator
# for resources being shared through more than one
# scheduler. We could say that it is an 'AND' scheduler:
# it reserves only in one scheduler.
#
# An interesting use case for this class is if an
# experiment can be shared through queues and booking.
# Depending on the reservation, it will only call one of
# the schedulers (the most appropriate). But whenever we
# want to know free slots or position in a queue, we
# have to ask all the aggregated systems.
#
# Another possible use case for this class would be
# sharing a single experiment through different mechanisms,
# such as weblabdeusto and an external one (VISIR, iLabs,
# Sahara). One of the schedulers would check in the
# internal database and define whether it is possible to
# serve the experiment or not
