class AliveUsersCollection(object):
    """
    AliveUsersCollection tracks the list of users who are not answering and
    whose session has expired. If a user's account has expired and s/he
    calls "send_command", send_command will first check that the user's
    account has not expired before acting, so it's not a big problem.

    But, if a user's browser crashes, or the user has problems with the
    network or whatever, normally no one would check this user's session
    status, which is a problem since this user may have resource to be
    disposed.

    So, this class manages those cases. It only has three methods:
        - add_user: adds a session_id
        - remove_user: removes a session_id
        - check_expired_users: checks and removes the users whose
            session has expired

    The first two methods manage the sessions which actively are alive.

    The last method finds expired sessions, removes them from the alive
    list and returns them. To do so, it checks all the alive sessions and
    removes those expired. Since this may become into blocking more often
    than required, and the operation may become too heavy, we use a config
    variable which checks that in each UPS the check_expired_users isn't
    called more often than a certain amount of time.

    This is checked per UPS server, not in the global memory, since placing
    it in global memory would actually create some blocking which wouldn't
    be desired. This way, the amount of calls to global memory is reduced
    to "once in a certain amount of time" + when adding/removing an alive
    user.
