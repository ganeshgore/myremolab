    ConcurrentExperiment is the concurrent version of the Experiment base class, and as
    such provides an interface for all concurrent experiments to implement.
    
    The key difference in concurrent experiments is that the same experiment instance
    may be in use by several different users at once. Consequently, most API methods
    have an additional lab_session_id parameter, which may be used to identify the
    particular user that is issuing that request.

        Reports the api version that the experiment uses. The default api level is the
        current one. Experiments may override this method to return a different one.

        TODO: Providing such a default might lead to errors, because if a new api was released
        old experiments which didn't override get_api would without warning be using a wrong api.
        It might be safer to enforce get_api() overriding, or to at least issue some kind of
        warning if an experiment doesn't.
