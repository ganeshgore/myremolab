# Since we can fix all these issues dynamically, we
# do it. This is easier to manage than changing the

#     ZSI and PyExpat
#
# Description:
#
#   ZSI used to use PyXML for parsing XML. This library
#   is really old, deprecated and doesn't count with
#   compilations for many platforms. However, its
#   functionality comes with the default Python Library,
#   so it should actually try to use this one instead of
#   PyXML. Actually, in the SVN they have started to use
#   it, but this change is not available in most
#   distributions. Due to this, we make ZSI use this
#   implementation.
