#
# CoordVersions:
#
# The coordinator servers will get informed of new or modified
# servers. They will have to update each other about the information
# they have. In order to do this, they'll have to interchange
# some kind of message.
#
# The problem here is concurrency. We can't have a simple number of
# version, since two different servers could increment it at the same
# time. We need every single server to have their own ID, and every
# coordinator server needs to have a map of { id : server_version }.
#
# Any time a server knows that anything changes, it will increase its
# own version, with the changes from the last version, and then it
# tell the changes to other servers.
#
# The possible problems of this approach are the lack of previous
# versions. If a server gets connected for first time, it doesn't have
# the previous versions of each server, so it doesn't know how to apply
# the changes. If a server loses a message, if it simply can't find it
# (it's on other network or something like that), or even worse, if a
# server misses to send a message, all the servers would get collapsed,
# because they wouldn't be able to update ones each other.
#
# Due to this possible problems, the versions system should be able to
# sum multiple patches. Something like "Changes between version 12 and
# 14". Patches should also be dependent on versions of other servers.
#
# So, a patch will have:
# a) That server's version number
# b) The dependencies of that version
# c) The changes themselves, in the following format:
#   an ordered list of a change:
#       1) CoordAddress
#       2) new | delete | switch_on | switch_off
# d) Servers which already know about this patch
#
# When a coordinator server receives a patch, it will check if it has
# already been applied. If it hasn't, it will try to apply it.
# To do so, it will check if the dependencies of the patch are matched.
# If they're not matched, it will ask the server who provided the patch
# for the dependencies, calculating which ones are needed. Once
# dependencies are all applied, the server will try to apply the patch
# itself. If successfully applied, it will add itself to the list of
# servers which already know about the patch, and will contact the rest
# of the servers.
#
# The main problem a coordinator server might have is receiving
# information from a server, with dependencies in earlier versions, and
# coming from other branch. In these cases, where integrity is in danger,
# the coordinator server will have to modify the new patch into another
# patch that will fit in the current branch. It will also contact the
# server which provided the patch to update it to the current branch.
#
# How are these modifications managed?

#
# As we can see, there are two kinds of conflicts here:
# a) A machine that we think that exists is said to be removed
# b) A machine that we think that doesn't exist is said to be switched
# on or off
# c) A machine that we think is switched on is said to be switched off
# or viceversa
#
# The only way to solve these conflicts is to check this information. To
# do so, if the coordinator server can talk with the machine directly, it
# will do so. If there is no way to contact, the coordinator server will
# just look for a coordinator which can talk with the server, or a coordinator
# that can talk with a coordinator which can talk with the server.

#
# Imagine machine1, which has instance1 and instance2, machine2,
# which has instance3, and instance4 is member of machine3, which
# is not modified. If everything (except for machine3) is modified,

#
# InstanceChange (3)
#    change = [ change, change ]
#
# If there is a problem in change1 at instance2, the server
# will still be able to apply changes in machine2, instance3,
# and instance1. If the problem is in machine2, changes in instance3
# will not be applicable, but still all machine1 and instance3 will.
#
# TODO: Consider deletes: if I create a machine, I delete it, I
# create it again, and I delete it again... well, somehow there can
# be problems. Should some changes modify other changes?
