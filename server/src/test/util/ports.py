This file pretends to make it possible that all the unit tests use a particular and somehow configurable 
port range (e.g. 10500 - 11000), so as to avoid conflicts with other applications. At this moment, the 
system uses random ports which are in conflict with production systems when
tests are run (e.g. in the continuous integration server).
