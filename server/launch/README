See https://weblabdeusto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html in order to install the system.

The credentials are "student1", "student2"... and "any" the password is "password".

Please, do keep in mind that although the list of experiments that appears is long, that's because 
in the database it is registered that way. In these configuration files few experiments are deployed,
typically only 'ud-dummy'.

In this directory you'll find several examples of configurations:
 * sample: it's the simplest one. Everything in the same process. Communication with the expermient through "Direct".
 * sample_balanced1: 2 core and login servers, 1 laboratory and experiment server. 
 * sample_balanced2: 3 core and login servers, 1 laboratory and experiment server. 
 * sample_balanced2_concurrent_experiments: 3 core and login servers, 3 laboratory servers, 100 experiment servers (80 active, 20 not used)
 * sample_xmlrpc: communication with experiment through XML-RPC
 * sample_internetsocket: communication with experiment through a TCP Socket
 * sample_unixsocket: communication with the experiment through a UNIX Socket

You can test them manually, or you can measure them using the Bot [ http://code.google.com/p/weblabdeusto/wiki/Latest_WebLabBot ].
