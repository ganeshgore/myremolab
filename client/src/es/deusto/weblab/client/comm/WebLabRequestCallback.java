/**
 * Callback to be invoked whenever a request finishes. Holds an internal
 * IWlAsyncCallback, which will be invoked if an error occurs. 
 * 
 * Though this callback does apparently have methods to support both success and error 
 * notification, receiving a response successfully does not necessarily mean that the
 * request succeeded. Hence the need for the aforementioned callback within this
 * callback.
 * 
 * Most often, a callback extending this WlRequestCallback will be used as the one 
 * to receive and parse the raw result of a query (that is, for instance, the JSON-encoded 
 * result). These extending classes will also rather often accept some kind of 
 * IWlAsyncCallback, which will be the one to handle the higher level (already parsed, 
 * not raw) result and logic. This extended IWlAsyncCallback will often include an 
 * onSuccess method, with a signature specific to that higher level response.
