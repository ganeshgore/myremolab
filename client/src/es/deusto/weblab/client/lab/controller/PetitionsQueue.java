/**
 * HTTP supports only two concurrent connections to the server
 * as specified in:
 * {@link http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-8.1.4}
 * 
 * We had some problems in WebLab-Deusto 2.0 with the Opera Mobile, 
 * since it used to enqueue all the petitions requested by the WebLab,
 * so if an image was requested, and then another image, and then a 
 * command was requested, the web browser would not send the command 
 * until the two images were served. In a few seconds, a lot of images
 * would block the queue and by the time the command was sent, the 
 * server had closed that session. 
 * 
 * In order to avoid this type of problems, WebLab-Deusto handles its
 * own queue, filtering the requests. If an image has been requested and
 * has not been served yet, any request of that image will be ignored, for
 * example. Any poll request will also be ignored if a command is being 
 * requested, and so on. Here is that implementation in GWT Java.
 * 
 * Rules:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Poll: only one at a time</li>
 * <li>Poll: only if there is no Command</li>
 * <li>Webcam Image: only one at a time</li>
 * <li>Order from most important to least important: Poll > Gui Image  > Command > Time > Webcam Image</li>
 * </ul>
