# Translations are very welcome. If you wish to use a translated version of this sytem,
# you can simply translate this file and contribute it to be available in the next release. 
# The Google Translator Toolkit is very convenient to translate this type of file.
# First, remove the '' of this file. The technology we use (Google Web Toolkit) requires
# us to write "Don''t" instead of "Don't", so you'll see a lot of '' in this document.
# So, using any text editor, replace all the '' by '. Then, go to: 
# http://translate.google.com/toolkit/ and upload the modified file. It will translate
# most of the text correctly, and then you only need to correct those words that are
# not accurate. Finally, contact the WebLab-Deusto developers ( weblab@deusto.es ) to
# incorporate it to the project.

upload              = Upload
thisDemoDemonstratesMultiresourceXilinx  = This demo demonstrates the multiresource queues of WebLab-Deusto. WebLab-Deusto supports that a single resource type can be used by different laboratories (therefore many laboratories share the same queue), and a laboratory can be built on top of different types of resources (and therefore, the laboratory internally uses more than one queue at the same time, which is probably shared with other laboratories). In this demo, you will use a CPLD or a FPGA depending on which one is available, but you can test that ud-demo-pld and ud-demo-fpga have their own queues. For instance, if you use one web browser to use the FPGA, you''ll see that using this demo you will not be assigned the FPGA. If this wasn''t a demo, you would select here the program that would be sent to the device. Since it could be harmful, in the demo we always send the same demonstration file.
