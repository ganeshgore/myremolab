- server
  - scheduling
    - support for batch experiments

    - scheduling system reimplemented in redis. Right now, to versions are
      supported: redis and sql. The SQL one has been tested on sqlite and MySQL
      (using pymysql and using MySQLdb). The redis version is the fastest, the
      sqlite is better one a single core is used, but the MySQLdb version is
      faster than the sqlite when more than one core server is used.

  - federation
    - support for federated experiments (sharing experiments among different 
      universities)

    - support for subcontracting experiments (university A provides experiment
      X to University B: then University B can provide experiment X to School
      C)

    - support for load balance among different universities (if university A 
      and B have experiment X, then users will see it as a single queue)

  - big module and package naming changes
    - modules are now lowercase and have more straightforward names

    - setup.py is now used to deploy the system.

  - weblab-admin is the script than now manages and creates weblab-deusto 
    instances.

  - A new web administrator is available, which covers all the administration 
    functionalities.

  - Drop MySQL, Apache as mandatory requirements. If you pass --http-server-port
    8000 to the weblab-admin creation script, it will deploy a small server
    useful for testing. MySQL is not mandatory since sqlite can also be used.

- experiments
  - Experimental support for LabVIEW Remote Panel as an unmanaged experiment

  - New experiments API to support concurrent experiments (where more than one
    user can be interacting with the equipment).

  - New expermients API that supports that students are kicked out if the
    laboratory considers that their session should end (e.g. if they fail in a
    game).

- requirements
  - Drop support for Python 2.5

- other
  - migrated from SVN to Mercurial and then to git.
